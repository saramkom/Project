    <h1>Staying Hydrated</h1>

    <h2><b>Did you know that approximatley 75% of adults are chronically dehydrated?</b></h2>
	<h3>What is the idea that you have for your app?</h3>
    <p><i>My application idea is one where you are able to track your daily water intake and set hydration goals for different times of the day! You could set notifications for different times you want to be reminded to check your water intake or to drink more water! It can be hard to remember to drink your recommended 8 cups per day, so this app will be here to help with that. The app would also log your previous days overall water intake so you could track your weekly or monthly water habits!
	</i></p>
	<h3>What part is 2D and what part is 3D?</h3>
	<p><i> Currently, my plan is to have most of the app in 2-D, but I will work to add some 3-D elements to add visual interest to the application. For example, I want to eventually add a 3-D water bottle that has animations that fill it up when user input water amounts. However most functionality aspects of the app will be 2-D. </i><p>
	<h3> What is your original, simple, hypothesis about this app? </h3>
		<p> <i> My hypothesis is by using this app, users will be able to become more aware of their water intake and gain better hydration habits. </i></p>
		<p> This would be a traditional web application as I'm currently unsure how augmented reality would improve user experience, but I'm open to suggestions! I think extended reality elements would also not significantly improve user experience and I'm also not entirely sure how they could be implemented in this type of application.
	<h3> Why is this idea important or needed in the world? </h3>
	<p><i> As mentioned above, approximatley 75% of people are chronically dehydrated and prolonged dehydration leads to many detrimental health effects. It can negatively effect your kidney and urinary health and also lead to heat related illnesses if dehydrated in hot environments. Overall, it's important to be hydrated but it can be tricky to remember to drink the recommended amount every day. </i></p>
	<h3>How do you plan to use XR emotionally to immerse the user in the experience?</h3>
	<p><i> I don't currently plan on adding any XR elements but if I did I would plan to try and implement some AR elements. Maybe you could be able to use your camera to scan or take a photo of the water you're drinking and your phone or whatever device the application was on could log the water intake that way. This would make user experience slightly easier as they wouldn't have to manually input their amounts. </i></p>
	<h3> List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not good for XR. </h3>
	<p><i><ul><li>Since XR elements are quite complicated to code, they would add siginifcant extra work that may not pay off as a signifcantly better user experiance. </li>
		<li> XR elements may make the app too complicated to the average user. I believe that a simpler manual input may take slightly longer for the user but it will give the app an overall cleaner and smoother functionality.</li>
		<li> XR elements also could make the app less accesible for different device types. For example, AR elements typically are best implemented on phones but if someone wanted to use the app on a computer, the AR elements would likely hinder the users ability to use the application. </li></i></p></ul>
	<h3> List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not better in 3D. </h3>
	<p><i><ul><li> Certain 3-D assests could add significant visual interest to the app and overall improve user experiance. </li>
	<li> 3-D elements could further engage users and make the application feel less flat. For example, as I previously mentioned, if I implemented a 3-D water bottle I could also make the water bottle interactable. This could be something as simple as making it so the user could spin the water bottle around when you click on it and have the water inside the bottle act like real water in 3-D. </li>
	<li> Using 3-D elements also makes the app overall more desirable to both advertisers and consumers since it gives the application another level of sophistication and polish, as opposed to a more rudimentary entirely 2-D app. </li></i></ul></p>
	<h3>In what way is each of AR, MR and VR possibly useful for the project?</h3>
	<p><i> As previously mentioned, AR elements could potentially be used to input water amounts by using your camera to scan or take a photo of the water you're drinking and your phone or whatever device the application was on could log the water intake that way. I'm currently unsure how MR or VR could be used in this type of application but I'm open to suggestions! </i></p>
	<h3> Auditing your idea: 
Does your idea exist in 2D?</h3>
<p><i>Currently yes my idea exists almost entirely in 2-D.</i></p>
<h3> Does your idea exist in 3D? </h3>
<p><i> Currently a small portion of my idea exists in 3-D.</i></p>
<h3> What could you do in your project in 3D that you can't do in 2D?</h3>
<p><i> Again, as previously mentioned the only elements that I could not implement in 2-D and would require 3-D to be properly done would be the AR elements mentioned before.</i></p>

<h3> Empathy Map:</h3>
	<h4> Emotions</h4>
	<p><i> Users may feel drained emotionally from life and find it difficult to remember to drink water and how much they've drank recently.</i></p>
	<h4> Environment</h4>
	<p><i> I would imagine the environment this app would be used in would vary greatly but maybe more often in the familiar settings like home, work or school since that is often where people drink water. </i></p>
	<h4> Think and Feel </h4>
	<p><i> Users may be overally distracted with the business of life and feel tired from that constant business. </i></p>
	<h4> See </h4>
	<p><i> This would vary signifcantly since people drink water many places, but maybe a faucet or water bottle is what they'd see.</i></p>
	<h4> Pains </h4>
	<p><i> Overall stresses from life and physical effects of being potentially dehydrated, like being tired and/or groggy.</i></p>

  <p><b>The water bottle above is a good visual representation of the concept I'm going for in 2-D, with every water input amount causing the water level in the bottle to increase.</b></p>
